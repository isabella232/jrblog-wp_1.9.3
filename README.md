jrconway_wp-gumby-less-theme
============================

Second major update. I added all code I could to the theme from my original theme. Instead of just
being exclusively for my site, this theme will first be created as a base template I can use on other
future projects.


The jrConway Responsive Blog template is a template designed to be used by DEVELOPERS to
make it easier to create a responsive wordpress template. This template is mainly designed so that I
have a base to work off of in the future, but can be used by anyone to do the same thing.

The template could potentially be used on its own as well, but its primarily designed just to be a
starting point for developers to base their themes off of. Of course, replace all references to
jrconwayblog with the name of your own template.

This template utilizes TwentyTwelve as a base, Gumby Framework, Twitter Bootstrap (for the icons),
and Less. The WP-Less Wordpress extension used in this template was created by Robert O'Rourke.
As this template uses LESS instead of normal CSS, this stylesheet page is only here to represent the
theme itself. All styles have been removed from this stylesheet.

All content areas that may potentially be editable are created as Widget Areas. Even the header can
be made into a widget area if no header image is provided.
