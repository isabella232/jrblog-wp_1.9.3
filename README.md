# jrBlog Responsive WP Theme
============================


jrBlog is a responsive wordpress template built for personal usage, but also as a template designed to be used by DEVELOPERS to make it easier to create a responsive wordpress template. The template works out of the box, but can also be used as a base for future wordpress templates, which I will be using it for as well.

This template utilizes TwentyTwelve as a base, Twitter Bootstrap, and Less. The WP-Less Wordpress extension used in this template was created by Robert O'Rourke. As this template uses LESS instead of normal CSS, this stylesheet page is only here to represent the theme itself. All styles have been removed from this stylesheet.

All content areas that may potentially be editable are created as Widget Areas. Even the header can be made into a widget area if no header image is provided.


### WIP

At this point in time it is still work-in-progress. I can only do so much while working on other things. I'm going to try and make nightly updates from now on, even if its a couple of minor issues, but I can't guarantee a thing.


## Update #7
Made some fixes to my LESS files to make them cleaner overall. The way I was doing it worked, but it wasn't very clean, and after some tweaking I managed to get it to work just by importing all my less stylesheets together into style.less. Before I couldn't get it working that way for some reason. I also added some fixes for a few styles from Twenty Twelve which were broken.

The next step is to add some more widget areas into the theme so I can put up social media buttons, and add social sharing links to other parts of the site.
