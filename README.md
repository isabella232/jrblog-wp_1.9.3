# jrBlog Responsive WP Theme
============================


jrBlog is a responsive wordpress template built for personal usage, but also as a template designed to be used by DEVELOPERS to make it easier to create a responsive wordpress template. The template works out of the box, but can also be used as a base for future wordpress templates, which I will be using it for as well.

This template utilizes TwentyTwelve as a base, Twitter Bootstrap, and Less. The WP-Less Wordpress extension used in this template was created by Robert O'Rourke. As this template uses LESS instead of normal CSS, this stylesheet page is only here to represent the theme itself. All styles have been removed from this stylesheet.

All content areas that may potentially be editable are created as Widget Areas. Even the header can be made into a widget area if no header image is provided.


### WIP

At this point in time it is still work-in-progress. I can only do so much while working on other things. I'm going to try and make nightly updates from now on, even if its a couple of minor issues, but I can't guarantee a thing.


## Update #6
Ok, this is basically done now. At least, its ready to go live. There's still some additional things I need to do with it, though. For example, I need to add a bunch of social sharing buttons to blog posts. I also need to add a lot of widget areas to various places, and I have so far been unable to make the theme responsive. I'm still working on trying to rectify these issues.

In any case, though, its done enough for me to put the site online, which is my primary goal. I'll still continue to work on this until I finish all the features I want. Then I can start to expand it and make more themes using this base template.
