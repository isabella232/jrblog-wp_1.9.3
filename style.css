Theme Name: jrBlog

Description: jrBlog is a wordpress template built for personal usage, but also as a
template designed to be used by DEVELOPERS to make it easier to create a wordpress
template. The template works out of the box, but can also be used as a base for future
wordpress templates, which I will be using it for as well.

This template utilizes TwentyTwelve as a base, Twitter Bootstrap, and Less. The WP-Less
Wordpress extension used in this template was created by Robert O'Rourke. As this template
uses LESS instead of normal CSS, this stylesheet page is only here to represent the
theme itself. All styles have been removed from this stylesheet.

All content areas that may potentially be editable are created as Widget Areas. Even the
header can be made into a widget area if no header image is provided.
